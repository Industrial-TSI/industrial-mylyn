The Industrial SQL connector for Mylyn is a framework with which one can quickly create a 
Mylyn connector to query tasks or issues stored in an SQL database.

A set of example projects is included, allowing connection with iBatis XML configuration files
or with JPA/EclipseLink annotations. A barebones in-memory connector is also provided. 

Originally developed as base for the Remain Software TD/OMS SDLC product Mylyn integration, 
the base framework was released as open source under the Eclipse Public License (EPL 1.0)
